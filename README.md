# IMAGE TO TEXT OCR

Ocrad.js is a pure-javascript version of Antonio Diaz Diaz's Ocrad project, automatically converted using Emscripten. It is a simple OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program that can convert scanned images of text back into text. Clocking in at about a megabyte of Javascript with no hefty training data dependencies (looking at you, Tesseract), it's on the lighter end of the spectrum.
